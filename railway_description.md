# Deploy and Host TeleCode on Railway

TeleCode is a powerful Telegram bot that transforms your mobile phone into a complete GitHub development environment. Connect to existing repositories, analyze code, edit files, commit changes, and manage your projectsâ€”all through simple Telegram commands. Use `/ask` for read-only code analysis and `/code` for making changes. Perfect for developers who want to code anywhere, anytime.

## About Hosting TeleCode

Hosting TeleCode involves deploying a Python-based Telegram bot that integrates with GitHub APIs and multiple LLM providers. The bot handles user authentication, repository management, AI-powered code generation, and automated Git operations. Railway's platform-as-a-service model is ideal for TeleCode as it provides persistent storage for user data, automatic SSL certificates for webhook endpoints, and seamless environment variable management. The deployment includes setting up webhook endpoints for Telegram, configuring GitHub access tokens, and establishing connections to AI providers like OpenRouter (recommended), Together AI, or OpenAI.

## Common Use Cases

- **Existing Repository Management** - Connect to any GitHub repository, manage branches, edit files, and commit changes through simple Telegram commands
- **Multilingual Development Teams** - Support international teams with built-in English and Portuguese language support for all bot interactions
- **AI-Assisted Coding** - Generate code, debug issues, and implement features using integrated LLM providers (OpenRouter, Together AI, OpenAI) with repository context awareness
- **Code Analysis and Learning** - Use `/ask` command for read-only code analysis, understanding complex systems, and learning from existing codebases without making changes
- **Emergency Hotfixes** - Deploy critical fixes instantly from anywhere using just your phone when urgent production issues arise  
- **Mobile Code Editing** - Edit existing codebases, add new features, and maintain projects through Telegram's intuitive interface
